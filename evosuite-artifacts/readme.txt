note that evosuite uses the user name of the computer in the scaffolding files as system properties, to hide the author name, we used 'ISSTA_USER', due to this reason, we are not sure if the tests will run on another machine.

to run all tests, use: scripts/run_tests.sh
to count the number of tests use : scripts/count_tests.sh
to count the sloc, use: scripts/sloc_count.sh
