Apache Commons RNG Examples Quadrature
======================================

The quadrature test application will output an approximation for &pi; (3.14159...) using
Monte-Carlo integration. The application generates random points within a unit box and counts
the number of points within the unit circle. The approximation to &pi; is made using the ratio of
the points within the circle to the total number of points, which should be &pi;/4.

Build the application using:

        mvn package -P examples-quadrature

Run the application using 2 arguments:

1. The number of random points
2. The name of the random generator

For example:

        java -jar target/examples-quadrature.jar 1000000 KISS

This will output:

        After generating 2000000 random numbers, the error on |ùõë - 3.14224| is 6.473464102070281E-4
